	  exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table) is a Microsoft file system optimized for flash drives. It is proprietary and patent-pending. It is 		  supported in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 with update KB955704, Windows Embedded CE 6.0, Windows Vista with Service Pack 1, 		  Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 R2 (except Windows Server 2008 Server Core), Mac OS X Snow Leopard starting 		  from 10.6.5, Mac OS X Lion and OS X Mountain Lion. exFAT can be used where the NTFS file system is not a feasible solution, due to data 		  structure overhead, or where the file size limit of the standard FAT32 file system (that is, without FAT32+ extension) is unacceptable.
	  Unlike NTFS, exFAT cannot pre-allocate disk space for a file by just marking arbitrary space on disk as 'allocated'. As in FAT, when 		  creating a file of known length, exFAT must perform a complete physical write equal to the size of the file.
	  exFAT is also supported in a number of media devices such as modern flat panel TVs, media centers, and portable media players

	  To compile this file system support select as a module only, choose M here. The modules will be called exfat_core.ko and exfat_fs.ko
